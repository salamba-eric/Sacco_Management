## Features

Here are some of the features the app has been built with:

1. .NET 6.0 Framework
2. Python
3. C#
4. Windows Presentation Forms

## Download & Use

To download and use the application; 
- click on the Release for this repository
- download the "Source Code.zip file"
- extract the zip file
- click on the "loan system.exe" to launch the app
- click on "refresh button" to load the applications

## Possible additions

After launching, there's a possibility your PC might not have the .Net 6.0 Framework. Follow the instruction on the pop up window to install it and it should run.

Also, incase you some buttons fail to run, it might be because Python is not installed in your computer. Please consider installing if you encounter this issue, as the app requires python to run.

## Conclusion

I created this app as part of my Software Engineering class 💯 and I hope it will help any learner out there to see the visual implementation of the Stack ADT.
If you encounter any errors feel free to write an issue on this repository, I will check it out.
