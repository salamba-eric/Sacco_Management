## Features

Here are some of the features the app has been built with:

1. .NET 6.0 Framework
2. Python
3. C#
4. Windows Presentation Forms

## Download & Use

To download and use the application; 
- click on the Release for this repository

## Possible additions

After launching, there's a possibility your PC might not have the .Net 6.0 Framework. Follow the instruction on the pop up window to install it and it should run.

Also, incase you some buttons fail to run, it might be because Python is not installed in your computer. Please consider installing if you encounter this issue, as the app requires python to run.
